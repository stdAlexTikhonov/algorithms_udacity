# The idea is to find the pivot point, divide the array in two sub-arrays and perform binary search.

# The main idea for finding pivot is – for a sorted (in increasing order) and pivoted array, pivot element is the only element for which next element to it is smaller than it.

# Using the above statement and binary search pivot can be found.

# After the pivot is found out divide the array in two sub-arrays.

# Now the individual sub – arrays are sorted so the element can be searched using Binary Search.

Time complexity: O(log(n))
Space complexity: O(1)
