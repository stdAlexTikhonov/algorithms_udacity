Task0
There no relations between input and output complexity is: O(1)
in terms on lines of code: O(10)

Task1
We have two loops in each of them some instractions with input, but approximation is: O(n)
in terms on lines of code: O(10n + 9)

Task2
We have to iterate over calls to combine calls in hash with call duration's, and then itarate over that hash, it is linear dependence: O(n)
in terms on lines of code: O(11n + 11)

Task3
Complexity: O(n)
in terms on lines of code: O(12n + 2m + 12) where m - codes from hash

Task4
Complexity: O(n)
in terms on lines of code: O(3n + 5m + 2k + 13) where n - texts, m - calls, k - telemarketers
