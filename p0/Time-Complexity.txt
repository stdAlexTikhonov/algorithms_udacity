Task0
There no relations between input and output complexity is: O(1)
in terms on lines of code: O(10)

Task1
We have two loops in each of them some instractions with input, but approximation is: O(n)


Task2
We have to iterate over calls to combine calls in hash with call duration's, and then itarate over that hash, it is linear dependence: O(n)

Task3
Complexity: O(n log n), because of "sotred"


Task4
Complexity: O(n log n) - sorted
